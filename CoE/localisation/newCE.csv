EVTNAME37299;The Colony of Libreville;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37299;Ever since the abolishment of slavery the African population of our country would flock back to the African continent is search of better life and/or freedom. One of the examples of this process is the free colony of Libreville set on the shores of Africa. We might want to take advantage of this and establish a colonial rule there as a long-term investment, or leave the people to their deserved freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37238;The 4 sergeants of La Rochelle;Les Quatre sergents de La Rochelle;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37238;In some regiments of the post-napoleonic army, loyalty for the monarchy was doubtful. The 45th Infantry Regiment was one of such, refusing to cheer the king. In 1822, four sergeants were found guilty of having organised a carbonari cell in their regiment and condemned to death. They were guillotined on the 21th september and quickly became martyr for the liberals. As Balzac said "it was the last attempt of the old army against the monarchy".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37239;Death of Louis XVIII;Mort de Louis XVIII;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37239;Disliked and even hated in liberal circles and at first in most parts of the military, Louis XVIII was restored on the throne in 1814 and 1815 and granted a constitutional charter. Targeted by songs, pamphlets and jokes, especially among the parisian revolutionaries and liberals, he nonetheless increased his popularity in rural and provincial France. His reign saw stability and order as well as the first true period of peace since 1789. France also experienced its first functional constitutional regime and started to gain a parliamentarian culture. The death of the King was welcomed with concern as his brother and successor was said to be quite reactionary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37240;Charles X's Coronation;Le sacre de Reims;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37240;Louis XVIII declined to be crowned, both because of his weak physical state and of political reasons. Despite his age, Charles X was unlike his brother in a most excellent health, a fact that played in his reign's early months popularity. Therefore, as a King more attached to tradition and the old regime pump, Charles X chose to be crowned in Reims. Despite the King's popularity at first, the magnificence of the ceremony and some artists' enthusiasm, the ceremony was met with politeness but not much more... except among liberal circles where concern grew.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37245;Paris' National Guard dissolution.;Dissolution de la garde nationale de Paris.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37245;French Prime minister was booed during a review of the Parisian National Guard. Subsequently, the King himself was welcomed most coldly. The national guard, as a middle class militia, was seen as an hotbed of agitation. Especially its parisian sections. For the government, such behavior was way too much similar to what happened to Louis XVI in the early 1790's. It choose to act and dissolved the parisian guard... forgetting to take the weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME37246;Billion Act and Anti-sacrilege act;Loi sur le sacrilege;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC37246;Charles X was rumored to be reactionary and to be wanting to erase what happened between 1789 and his accession. The Anti-sacrilege act made any desacration of sacred objects or vessels an offense punished by death. It was thought as an expiation of revolutionary sacrilege and planed very "old-regimy" punishments. The law was met with an uproar among liberals and a large part of the Catholic but anti-clerical population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME1000200;The New Protector of Eastern Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000200;Now that we are powerful enough to hold our own, an important matter rose up regarding our role in the Eastern Christendom. It is a well known fact that the Byzantine Empire for a long time was the center of the Orthodox Church and the Eastern Christendom as a whole. Sadly, we've lost our authority and power due to numerous wars and raids and our title as the protector was taken by an another powerful Orthodox nation known as the Russian Empire. We are glad that they've been doing our work for centuries now, but it's time that we take this title back since it's supposed to be us that should protect the Eastern Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000201;The Orthodox Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000201;We've been notified that the newly restored Byzantine Empire seeks to recaim its title as the Orthodox Protector. We've taken their duty to continue protecting the Eastern Christendom as a powerful nation within it. Should we stand down and give the title back to its original owner, or should we hold onto it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000202;The Russian Empire refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000202;The fools of The Russian Empire refuted our rightfull claim on the title of the Orthodox Protector. The title is ours by definition and they will pay for denying us our claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000203;The Russian Empire accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000203;As we expected, the Russians complied and offered back the title of Eastern Protectors. This is a joyous day for the mighty Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000204;The War is Won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000204;We have proven in battle that we are truly worth the title we were fighting for. The Russian Empire will have to agree to our demands and our position in the Eastern Christendom will be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME1000205;The War is Lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000205;We have lost the war and forever lost the right to call ourselves the Protectors of Eastern Christendom. The new title owners have proven themselves to be more suitable for this role and we'll have to set our sights elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
